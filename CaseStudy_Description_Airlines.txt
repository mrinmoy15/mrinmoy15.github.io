Case Study: Analysing flight details for all commercial flights within the USA in January 2008:
Data analysis is done using RHadoop to address the following questions:
-To compute the total number of flights distributed across each day of the month.
-To compute the total number of canceled flights operated by each airliner and the reason for Cancelation.
-To identify the distribution of overall flight delay across various days of the month.
-To compute total airtime and average distance metrics at Year, Month, DayofMonth and DayofWeek levels.
-To identify which is the busiest route.


Description: 

Here a data set called Airlines.txt that consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights 
within the USA in January 2008. Submit RHadoop code for the listed questions.
You have to make use of plyrmr package functions for answering these questions unless mentioned otherwise.

1. Write a mapreduce program to compute the total number of flights distributed across each day of the month. 
Plot the final output using ggplot2 package functions.

2. Write a mapreduce program to compute the total number of canceled flights operated by each airliner for the year 2008 
and the reason for Cancelation. Plot the final output using ggplot2 package functions.

3. Write a mapreduce program to identify the distribution of overall flight delay across various days of the month.
Plot the final output using ggplot2 package functions. 

4. Write a mapreduce program to compute total airtime and average distance metrics at Year,
Month, DayofMonth and DayofWeek levels.

5. Write a mapreduce program to identify which is the busiest route of all for the year 2008. Route
can be achieved by using a combination of “Origin” and “Dest” variables.

6. In 2008, which airliner recorded the highest number of diverted flights? For this airliner, compute
the monthly averages of distance traveled by both normal and diverted flights for the year 2008?
