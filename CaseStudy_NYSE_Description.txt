Case Study: Analysis of NYSE stock data using RHadoop to 
a) comute average weekly (52 weeks) stock prices for different stock labels. 
b) identify top 10 stock labels that have the highest volumes (sum) of stocks traded.
c) to identify which stock symbol had the highest fluctuation in price value on any given day.
d) to compute aggregated average of daily mean value of stocks.

Description: 
The data set needed for this is given in a Stocks file named NYSE_Stocks.txt which is a comma separated text file with 812,989 records and 9 variables.
Using the given data, please provide solutions in the form R scripts to the below questions.

1. Write a mapreduce program to compute average weekly (52 weeks) stock prices for stock label "AIG" for the year 2001 and plot the output using visualization.

2. Write a mapreduce program to identify top 10 stock labels that have the highest volumes (sum) of stocks traded in the year 2001. For these labels, 
compute the total stock volumes traded in the year 2000 and compute the YOY percentage changes.

3. Write a mapreduce program to identify which stock symbol had the highest fluctuation in price value on any given day? For this question, you should use 
only 5 stock labels that are "AIG", "JNPR", "GE", "IBM", and “DIS".

4. Write a mapreduce program to compute aggregated average of daily mean value of stocks. As a first step, you will try calculate the daily mean for each 
line using the open and close prices. Then you need to group together all of the daily means for each stock symbol across multiple days and then compute 
the aggregated average value for all stock symbols across all day.
